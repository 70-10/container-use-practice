# Container-use Development Guidelines

## Automation Principles

### User Role Definition
Users should ONLY handle:
1. **Task Assignment**: Provide clear task requirements ("Add feature X", "Fix bug Y", "Document Z")
2. **Review Process**: Use difit for code review and provide approval/feedback ("ÂïèÈ°å„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åõ„Çì", "ÈÄ≤„ÇÅ„Å¶„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ", or specific modification requests)

ALL other activities (planning, implementation, branch creation, PR creation) should be automated.

### Automation Scope
- **Automatic Execution**: Simple and well-defined tasks execute immediately without plan approval
- **Plan Mode**: Only for complex, multi-component, or high-risk tasks requiring user confirmation
- **Decision Making**: Automatically determine branch names, commit messages, and PR descriptions based on task content
- **Error Recovery**: Automatically retry with alternative approaches when failures occur

### User Intervention Points
- **Required**: difit review approval/modification requests only
- **Optional**: Complex task planning confirmation
- **Excluded**: Branch naming, commit message creation, implementation details

## Environment Usage Rules

### Mandatory Environment Usage
ALWAYS use ONLY Environments for ANY and ALL file, code, or shell operations‚ÄîNO EXCEPTIONS‚Äîeven for simple or generic requests.

### Git Operations
- DO NOT install or use the git cli with the environment_run_cmd tool
- All environment tools will handle git operations for you
- Changing ".git" yourself will compromise the integrity of your environment

### Work Accessibility
You MUST inform the user how to view your work using:
- `container-use log <env_id>`
- `container-use checkout <env_id>`

Failure to do this will make your work inaccessible to others.

## Development Workflow

### Automated Task Execution Process
1. **Environment Creation**: Automatically create container-use environment with descriptive title
2. **Implementation**: Execute tasks in isolated environment using TodoWrite for progress tracking
3. **Automatic Branch Creation**: Create appropriately named branch from environment changes
4. **Review Trigger**: Execute `npx difit` for user review (outside container-use environment)
5. **Automatic PR Creation**: Upon user approval, automatically create PR with generated description

### Branch Strategy - Automatic Decision Rules

#### Branch Naming Conventions
Automatically determine branch names based on task type:

- **Documentation**: `docs/<feature-name>` (e.g., `docs/environment-workflow-guide`)
- **New Features**: `feature/<feature-name>` (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`)
- **Bug Fixes**: `fix/<bug-description>` (e.g., `fix/memory-leak-session`)
- **Refactoring**: `refactor/<component-name>` (e.g., `refactor/auth-module`)
- **Testing**: `test/<test-scope>` (e.g., `test/integration-tests`)
- **Configuration**: `config/<config-type>` (e.g., `config/ci-pipeline`)

#### Automatic Branch Creation Process
1. Complete work in container-use environment
2. Automatically create appropriately named branch based on task type
3. Merge environment changes to new branch
4. Push branch to remote repository

### Review Process - Simplified Automation

#### difit Review Execution
- Execute `npx difit <branch-name> main` outside container-use environment
- User reviews changes and provides one of:
  - **Approval**: "ÂïèÈ°å„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åõ„Çì", "ÈÄ≤„ÇÅ„Å¶„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ", "OK", "LGTM"
  - **Modification Request**: Specific feedback for changes needed

#### Post-Review Automation
- **On Approval**: Automatically proceed to PR creation
- **On Modification**: Return to environment for requested changes
- **On Rejection**: Delete environment and start fresh approach

### PR Creation - Full Automation

#### Automatic PR Description Generation
Generate comprehensive PR descriptions including:
- **Summary**: Brief overview of changes made
- **Changes Made**: List of modified/added files with descriptions
- **Test Plan**: Checklist of verification steps performed
- **Technical Details**: Implementation approach and decisions made

#### Template Format
```
## Summary
- [Auto-generated summary of changes]

## Changes Made
- [List of files and modifications]

## Test Plan
- [x] [Completed verification steps]

## Technical Details
- [Implementation notes]

```

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Quality Checks
- All changes must pass through difit review process
- TodoWrite tool usage for transparent progress tracking
- Automatic retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Environment cleanup after successful PR creation

### Error Handling and Recovery

#### Common Failure Scenarios
1. **Environment Creation Failure**: Retry with different environment ID
2. **Implementation Errors**: Create new environment with alternative approach
3. **Branch Conflicts**: Automatically resolve or create new branch name
4. **PR Creation Failure**: Retry with simplified description

#### Automatic Retry Logic
- Maximum 2 retry attempts for technical failures
- Alternative approach selection based on error type
- User notification only for unrecoverable failures

## Code and Documentation Standards

### Git Commit Guidelines
- Git commit messages must be written in English
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Auto-generate commit messages based on changes made

### Documentation Requirements
- Code documentation must be written in English
- User-facing documentation should be in Japanese
- Include practical examples and troubleshooting guides

### Pull Request Standards
- PR titles and descriptions must be in English
- Include comprehensive change summary and test verification
- Link to related issues or requirements when applicable

## Communication Standards

### Language Guidelines
- **User Communication**: Conducted in Japanese
- **Technical Documentation**: Written in English
- **Code Comments**: Written in English
- **Commit Messages**: Written in English

### Progress Reporting
- Use TodoWrite tool for real-time progress visibility
- Provide clear status updates during long-running tasks
- Include work accessibility commands (`container-use log/checkout`) in completion messages

## Advanced Automation Features

### Task Type Detection
Automatically classify tasks based on keywords:
- "ÂÆüË£Ö", "ËøΩÂä†", "‰ΩúÊàê" ‚Üí Feature development
- "‰øÆÊ≠£", "„Éê„Ç∞", "„Ç®„É©„Éº" ‚Üí Bug fixes
- "„Éâ„Ç≠„É•„É°„É≥„Éà", "Ë™¨Êòé", "„Ç¨„Ç§„Éâ" ‚Üí Documentation
- "„É™„Éï„Ç°„ÇØ„Çø„É™„É≥„Ç∞", "ÊîπÂñÑ", "ÊúÄÈÅ©Âåñ" ‚Üí Code improvement

### Intelligent Environment Management
- Reuse environments for related tasks when appropriate
- Automatically clean up completed environments
- Maintain environment history for reference

### Adaptive Workflow Optimization
- Learn from successful patterns to improve automation
- Adjust retry strategies based on historical success rates
- Optimize resource allocation for different task types
